# 📚 Resources

Here, we'll provide links to other materials online that contain practice problems and alternative explanations of the course material. Find anything that you think is helpful or interesting? Let us know and we'll add it here.

Note that some of these resources will use different notation and terminology than we do in the course. Some examples include:
- the **image** of a matrix $$A$$, $$\text{im}(A)$$, which we call the **column space** of $$A$$, $$\text{colsp}(A)$$.
- the **kernel** of a matrix $$A$$, $$\text{ker}(A)$$, which we call the **null space** of $$A$$, $$\text{nullsp}(A)$$.
- the **nullity** of a matrix $$A$$, $$\text{nullity}(A)$$, which we call the **dimension of the null space** of $$A$$, $$\dim(\text{nullsp}(A))$$.

## Textbooks

The one textbook that I've referenced the most while developing EECS 245 is [Introduction to Linear Algebra](https://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/ila6/indexila6.html) by Gilbert Strang. (The textbook itself isn't free, but this link contains links to several chapters and old exams.) You can find many of his videos [online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MtwqhIwdrI&list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8).

The following textbooks are more similar in style to our course notes, in that they're (somewhat) designed from the perspective of machine learning.
- [Linear Algebra: Essence & Form](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/preprints/LAEF.pdf) by Robert Ghrist.
- [Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/vmls/vmls.pdf) by Boyd and Vandenberghe.
- [Mathematical Methods in Data Science](https://mmids-textbook.github.io/index.html) by Sebastien Roch.

## Exams and Practice Problems

### Linear Algebra (Chapter 2, Chapter 5)

- [Problems in Linear Algebra](https://www.lem.ma/books/Ai_Km5W5WPfsPZqqV2XWGg/problems), a site with interactive problems (multiple choice and short answer).
- [18.06](https://web.mit.edu/18.06/www/old.shtml) at MIT.
- [Math 214](https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/courses/214/exams.html) at Michigan.
- [ECE 133A](https://www.seas.ucla.edu/~vandenbe/133A/133A-exercises.pdf) at UCLA.
- [Math 4571](https://dummit.cos.northeastern.edu/teaching_sp23_4571) at Northeastern.

### Linear Regression and Machine Learning (Chapter 1, Chapter 3, Chapter 4)

- [Michigan EECS 398's Study Site](https://study.practicaldsc.org/): poke around for practice problems; each exam or worksheet likely has _something_ that's relevant to our course.
- [UCSD DSC 40A's Practice Site](https://practice.dsc40a.com/): ^likewise. In particular, these worksheets may be of interest:
    - [Constant Model](https://practice.dsc40a.com/summary-statistics-and-the-constant-model/index.html).
    - [Simple Linear Regression](https://practice.dsc40a.com/simple-linear-regression/index.html).
    - [Matrices and Vectors](https://practice.dsc40a.com/matrix-vectors-properties/index.html).
    - [Gradient Descent and Convexity](https://practice.dsc40a.com/gradient-descent-convexity/index.html).
