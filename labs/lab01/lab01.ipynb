    "2. Read through the notebook to make sure everything is fine and all tests passed.\n",
    "3. Run the cell below to run all tests, and make sure that they all pass.\n",
    "4. Download your notebook using `File -> Download`, then upload your notebook to Gradescope under \"Lab 1\".\n",
    "5. Stick around for a few minutes while the Gradescope autograder grades your work. Make sure you see that all **public tests** have passed on Gradescope.\n",
